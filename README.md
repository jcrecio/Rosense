# Rosense
Python Robot for Monitoring DGT Traffic Information from Road M-40 Spain.

Rosense connects to the public website provided by DGT Spain to extract traffic information. 
It provides both endpoints for running Rosense and for getting in-memory information extracted.

In order to run it is required to run Rosenserver.py,
1) localhost:5050/start runs the robot
2) localhost:5050/sensors gets the latest information

Rosense is looking forward to contain all the data extracted into a database and be configurable to be run in any server, to be more configurable, to get more data and of the different kind, so on.
